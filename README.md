GENIE (Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) is a universal
object-oriented neutrino MC generator supported and developed by an [international 
collaboration](http://genie.hepforge.org/collaboration.html) of scientists whose
expertise covers a very broad range of neutrino
physics aspects, both phenomenological and experimental. GENIE is currently being
used by T2K, NOvA, MINERvA, MicroBooNE, ArgoNEUT, LAGUNA-LBNO, LBNE, INO, IceCUBE,
NESSiE and others.

This is an unofficial repository for the 2.8 series of the GENIE Neutrino
Event MC generator. Please see the [official webpage](http://genie.hepforge.org)
for code that is appropriate for publications-level physics analysis.

GENIE uses several third-party HEP codes:

* [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch)
* [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org)
* [Pythia](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html)

GENIE also uses [log4pp](http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net) and the [Gnu 
Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
